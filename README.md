# Item-Catalog

# About the project

In this project for the Udacity FullStack Nanodegree we needed to create a webb app that will allow us to login using google or facebook OAuth. To get everything working together harmoniously, we used different languages to create this app: (SQL, Flask, Python, HTML, CSS). 

With proper code formatting we need 3 python files: lotsofitems.py, project.py, and database_setup.py, to set the stage for the page.

# Use

To run the program you will need to run vagrant in Virtual Box, and python. Cloning the following repository will also be needed to successfully run the program. You can clone the repo by the following command git clone https://github.com/RoyalFlush24/Item-Catalog.

Using the terminal or cmd prompt, cd, into the fullstack-nanodegree-vm file will allow you to access the vagrant file by means of cd vagrant. Now use the following command vagrant to get your vagrant cmd line up and running.  Vagrant (ssh) allows you to log into the vagrant system.

# To Run it

Use these command lines to get it up and running:

CD into item-catalog

  1. python database_setup.py - will create a database 

  2. python lotsofitems.py - will populate your database with the items 

  3. python project.py - will run the project file for you to be able to see it on localhost:5000
  
  4. Open up google chrome and type in localhost:5000 and voila.
